# README

This is part of the Private Events Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events

To see this project in action, do the following:

1. Clone this repo. If you don't know how, follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

2. If you have rails installed, skip this step. If not, install rails. Here's a [resource](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails) on how to do it

3. Navigate into the cloned repository via `cd private-events` in your terminal.

4. Run `rails server`

5. Open up a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

6. Try to make up some test accounts and play around. That's it :D


### Some after-thoughts
This was a more demanding project than I expected it to be, particularly because I chose to try to create batch invites, which basically set up multiple database records in one single HTTP request. That one was tricky.

I think there is some code that could use refactoring, probably will come back to that in the future
